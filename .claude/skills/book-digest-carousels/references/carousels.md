# Carousels: voice, copy rules + editable SVG templates

A carousel is a short, scannable visual thread — not the digest. Each carousel
takes **one idea** from a chapter and makes it land, in the user's own design.

## Voice

Write as a **fellow learner**, not a guru. The user is learning these concepts too
and wants to help others get them. So: plain English, relatable, "here's the thing
that finally made this click for me", never lecturing or jargon-as-branding. Define
terms the moment they appear. Warmth and honesty ("this one tripped me up") beat
authority.

**Sound human, not generated.** No em dashes (use commas, periods, or parentheses).
Skip "it's not X, it's Y" phrasing and forced rule-of-three lists. Contractions and
short fragments are good. **Don't name the source book on the slides** (chrome stays
topic-based like "SYSTEMS · 01"); the concepts are common knowledge in your own words,
so there's nothing to attribute. Just never copy the source's exact wording.

**Never reveal that a book (or course, or any study material) is behind the post.** The
slides are Mayowa's own take on a **topic**, full stop. Naming the book is only half the
rule: **no source-shaped words anywhere in the copy**, including the cover title and
subtitle. Banned: "chapter", "this chapter", "the book", "this book", "the author",
"the text", "the course", "reading", "Ch.1", "pages", "the material". These are tells
even when the title is never mentioned.

Rewrite the tell as a claim about the subject itself:

| ❌ Tell | ✅ Topic-first |
|--------|----------------|
| "That rule explains half this chapter." | "That rule explains half of how MySQL behaves." |
| "This chapter covers three qualities." | "Three qualities decide whether a system is any good." |
| "The author calls this a fault." | "This is what people mean by a fault." |
| "What I'm reading about replication…" | "What finally made replication click for me…" |

First-person learning framing is welcome ("what finally made this click for me", "this
one tripped me up") because that's Mayowa's voice. Pointing at *study material* is not.
(Digests are the opposite: they **must** cite the source in "Sources & verify". This
no-tells rule is **carousels only**.)

**Punchy, but never a false universal.** A hook can be bold without stating one common
setup as a universal law. Watch the absolutes (**always, never, only, every, must,
can't, guarantees**) and ask whether the claim is true generally or only in a particular
configuration, version, or architecture. Keep the punch, and carry the boundary in the
line itself or the subtitle instead of stacking caveats:

| ❌ Universal (wrong) | ✅ Bounded (still punchy) |
|---|---|
| "Every MySQL write goes through ONE server." | "In the usual MySQL setup, every write goes through ONE server." |
| "One server takes the writes. Period." | "One server takes the writes, in the common source-replica setup." |
| "SQL has one writer." | "A typical MySQL cluster has one writer." |

One bounding word ("usually", "by default", "in a common pattern") is normally enough.
Bound the claim once, clearly, then get on with the story — **never bury the deck in
caveats**. Full rule: see "Bounded claims" in the skill's Content guardrails.

**ASCII only for arrows and diagram glyphs.** Write `->`, `<->`, `x` (not `→`, `↔`, `▶`),
and draw panels with `| + [ ] v ^ #` (not box-drawing `┌ ─ │ ▓`). The headline font
(Bricolage Grotesque) has no arrows or box-drawing, so they render as missing-glyph boxes
in a `title` or `heading` (the lint blocks that). Keep it ASCII everywhere to be safe.

## Length

**7–10 slides.** Never ship a scanty carousel. **7 is the floor** — the best idea gets
the full arc, one slide per beat: cover, orient, crux, visual proof, incident, practical
application, close. A richer chapter expands a beat or two (a second explanation, a
second proof) up to **10**. Every deck keeps its three anchors: a real **explanation**
of the topic, the **visual-proof** slide, and a **real case study**. Depth wins over
brevity, but it should still never feel padded.

- Slide 1 hooks: a promise, a surprising number, or "I kept getting this wrong."
- One thought per slide. Short lines. No paragraphs — this is glanceable.
- Include **one `code` visual-proof slide per deck** (the tiny schematic, see below);
  add further `code` slides only if another snippet genuinely carries a point.
- Close with the takeaway distilled to a line, plus a light CTA.

## Signature structure (match this — the AWS core-networking carousel is the benchmark)

The carousels the user loves read like a short **story**, not a list of facts. Match
this arc (each numbered beat is one `concept` slide unless noted):

1. **Cover / hook** — frame a real tension or realization in the learner's voice
   ("Public subnet or private subnet? It's ONE line in a table."). The subtitle is a
   first-person promise ("The route table trick that finally made VPC click for me.").
2. **Orient** (kicker e.g. `THE SETUP`) — one plain-language slide giving the beginner
   the ground they need ("Everything in AWS lives inside a VPC").
3. **The crux** — put the single **concrete artifact** at the centre as the heading: a
   real value, row, command, or number (`0.0.0.0/0 pointed at an internet gateway =
   public`), then explain it simply. Specific always beats abstract.
4. **Visual proof (REQUIRED — one per deck).** A `code`-panel slide that *shows* the
   crux as a tiny monospace schematic instead of describing it: a route-table snippet,
   a replication fan-out, a fault → failure flow, a next-token strip. See "The
   visual-proof slide" below. This is the beat that turns "I read it" into "I see it."
5. **Why it matters — a real, named, dated case study (REQUIRED).** Tie the small
   detail to a real incident with stakes: the Feb 2017 S3 typo outage, the Dec 2021
   AWS outage, a documented postmortem. **Verify it with a quick web search; never
   invent an incident, date, or number.** This is the beat that makes the set land.
6. **Bring it home** (kicker e.g. `SAME INSTINCT, SMALLER STAKES`) — scale it back to
   the learner's own situation: the practical caution, or how to apply it day to day.
7. **Close / takeaway** — the whole thing distilled to one memorable line, plus the
   Follow CTA, avatar, name, and the social handles.

**Kickers are punchy and specific**, never generic: "THE ONE ROW THAT DECIDES IT" and
"WHY THIS ROW MATTERS SO MUCH" beat "Definition" and "Example". Footer chrome stays
topic-based ("aws · route tables") with the `@mayowa` handle. Every track (DDIA, AI
Engineering, MySQL, AWS) follows this same arc — it is not AWS-only.

**Length is 7–10 — the seven beats above ARE the floor, not a menu to trim.** Give the
best idea all seven, one slide each: cover, orient, crux, visual proof, incident,
practical application, close. Don't fold beats together to go shorter — 7 is the
minimum. Scale toward **10** by expanding a beat when the idea has that much to show.
**Never pad to hit a number, and never drop below 7.**

## The visual-proof slide (required, one per deck)

Every deck includes **exactly one** `code`-template slide whose job is to *show* the
idea, not tell it. The `code` template is a terminal-window panel with a monospace body
(JetBrains Mono, line breaks preserved), so a small ASCII/box schematic renders crisply
and on-brand. Keep it **≤ 13 lines and ≤ ~40 characters wide** so it never shrinks to
unreadable. **Draw it in ASCII only:** `-> <- | + [ ] : v ^ #`. Do NOT use Unicode arrows
or box-drawing (`→ ▶ ┌ ┐ └ ┘ ├ ┤ │ ─ ▓`) anywhere on a slide; depending on the font they
render as missing-glyph boxes (this is exactly what broke a heading once).
Put a short `kicker` (e.g. `SEE IT`), a `filename` label, the schematic in `code`
(`data-pre` keeps your line breaks), and a one-line `caption` under the panel. If a value
is illustrative (a probability, an ID), keep it obviously rounded/example — per the
guardrails, don't pass invented numbers off as real.

One per track, matched to the chapter's crux:

```
AWS - route table (filename: route-table)        DDIA - fault vs failure (fault-model)
Destination    Target                            fault -> [ caught in time? ]
10.0.0.0/16    local                                        |yes        |no
0.0.0.0/0      igw-0abc   <- public                         v           v
                                                         contained    FAILURE

MySQL/DDIA - replication (replication)           AI Engineering - next token (predict)
          writes                                 "the cat sat on the ___"
Primary --+--> Replica A  (reads)                  mat    #######  0.71
          +--> Replica B  (reads)                  floor  #        0.09
   async, may lag                                  roof   #        0.04
```

These are the *shape*, not gospel: adapt the schematic to whatever the unit's crux is
(an index B-tree, a queue, a cache-aside path). The point is a glanceable picture that
proves the concept.

## Fixed per-track chrome (never drifts)

The `terminal` path and the `counter` prefix are the track's identity. They must be
**byte-for-byte identical across every carousel in that track, chapter after chapter** —
`~/learning/ai` never becomes `~/learning/ai-engineering`, `~/learning/systems` never
becomes `~/learning/ddia`. Always use exactly these:

| Track | `terminal` | counter prefix |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Designing Data-Intensive Applications | `~/learning/systems` | `SYSTEMS` |
| AI Engineering | `~/learning/ai` | `AI` |
| High Performance MySQL | `~/learning/sql` | `SQL` |
| AWS | `~/learning/aws` | `AWS` |

The cover's `counter` is `<PREFIX> · NN` (the chapter/topic number, e.g. `AI · 03`).

**Every other slide uses `NN / TOTAL`, where `TOTAL` is the number of NON-cover slides**
and `NN` is that slide's position among them, starting at `01`. The cover is an unnumbered
title card, so it is **not** counted in `TOTAL`. That means **the last slide must always
read `N / N`** — a final slide showing `07 / 08` is a bug: it tells the reader another
slide is coming when the deck has ended.

For an 8-slide deck (cover + 7 others):

```
slide 1 (cover)  ->  SQL · 01      <- track chrome, not a fraction
slide 2          ->  01 / 07
slide 3          ->  02 / 07
...
slide 8 (close)  ->  07 / 07       <- numerator == denominator, always
```

Only the footer `tags` (e.g. `ai · foundation models`) vary by subtopic — the terminal
and prefix never do.

## The templates (already built, on-brand)

Four editable SVGs in `assets/templates/`, dark theme with a red `#C8453A` accent,
mono "terminal" chrome, and the user's photo as a circular avatar. Canvas 1080×1350.
Fonts (bundled in `assets/fonts/`, mapped in `assets/fonts.json`): **Bricolage
Grotesque** (display headlines, wght 700/800), **Inter** (body, 400), **JetBrains
Mono** (all mono chrome: terminal path, counters, eyebrow kickers, code, captions,
handle, CTA — weights 400/500/700).

Fields per template:

- `cover` — `terminal`, `counter`, `title`, `subtitle`, `swipe`
- `concept` — `terminal`, `counter`, `kicker`, `heading`, `body`, `handle`, `tags`
- `code` — `terminal`, `counter`, `kicker`, `heading`, `filename`, `code`, `caption`, `handle`, `tags`
- `close` — `terminal`, `counter`, `kicker`, `heading`, `body`, `cta`, `name`, `tagline`

Any field left empty is simply omitted, so slides degrade gracefully.

## deck.json (what the renderer consumes)

```json
{
  "slides": [
    { "template": "cover", "fields": {
        "terminal": "~/learning/sql", "counter": "SQL · 01",
        "title": "The 3 SQL joins I kept mixing up",
        "subtitle": "The mental model that finally made them stick.",
        "swipe": "SWIPE →" } },
    { "template": "concept", "fields": {
        "terminal": "~/learning/sql", "counter": "01 / 04",
        "kicker": "THE MENTAL MODEL",
        "heading": "Picture two tables as circles",
        "body": "INNER JOIN keeps only the overlap.\n\nLEFT JOIN keeps everything on the left, blanks on the right.",
        "handle": "@yourhandle", "tags": "sql · joins" } },
    { "template": "code", "fields": {
        "terminal": "~/learning/sql", "counter": "02 / 04",
        "kicker": "SEE IT", "filename": "inner-join",
        "code": "users        orders\n1 ann        1 ann\n2 ben        1 ann\n\nINNER  ->  keeps only id 1",
        "caption": "The overlap is the whole point: no match, no row.",
        "handle": "@yourhandle", "tags": "sql · joins" } },
    { "template": "close", "fields": {
        "kicker": "THE TAKEAWAY",
        "heading": "INNER = overlap. LEFT = keep the left.",
        "body": "Pick the join by which rows you refuse to lose.",
        "cta": "Follow — I post what I learn",
        "name": "Your Name", "tagline": "learning in public" } }
  ]
}
```

Use `\n` in a field to force a line break; otherwise text wraps automatically. The deck
above is **abbreviated to show the field shapes** — a real deck runs the full 7–10 slides
(cover, orient, crux, visual proof, incident, practical application, close).

## Rendering

```bash
python scripts/render_carousels.py \
  --templates assets/templates --fonts assets/fonts.json \
  --content output/carousels/mon/deck.json --out output/carousels/mon/
```

The renderer word-wraps each field to its box, shrinks the font until it fits, and
rasterizes each slide to `slide_01.png … slide_NN.png` with cairosvg.

## Editing the design

Each dynamic text is a `<text>` with a `{{field}}` token and `data-*` attributes:
`data-field`, `data-box-w`, `data-max-lines`, `data-size`/`data-min-size`,
`data-line-height`, `data-align`, and `data-pre="true"` (keep line breaks, for code).
Edit the SVGs to move boxes or change colors; swap TTFs in `assets/fonts/` (and
`assets/fonts.json`) to change typography. The circular avatar is `assets/brand/logo.png`.

If the user sends new designs, the cleanest input is an SVG exported with **live
text** (not outlined); otherwise rebuild by keeping the non-text vector parts and
adding `<text>` fields.
